👋 Hey there, I'm Vadzim Krukouski! 🚀

🧪 A biotechnology grad turned MEng student in Bioinformatics at Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences, I'm fervently exploring the intersections of bioinformatics, biotechnology, and data science.

🎪 Circus lover! Find me juggling, axe-throwing, or both, as I embrace the vibrant world of circus arts.

🌐 A linguaphile in the making - fluent in Belarusian, English, Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian, and eagerly exploring more.

👨‍💻 My repository is a melting pot of my academic ventures and eclectic hobbies. Excited to connect, collaborate, and learn together.
